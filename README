Anonymous Feedback
======================

Small webapp to provide a anonymous feedback form for students to rate their TAs.
Its an all to common problem for students to not know their TA by name nor their email.
Our platform uses the course code and section to help find the TA students had.


###Database
You will need to create a `dbconn.conf` file like the following snippet in the root directory with _dbhandler.py_

```
[Default]
IP = 127.0.0.1
port = 5432
user = feed
password = meh
database = feedback
```
